    <h1><a name="WhatsThis"></a>What's this Virtual Machine?</h1>
    <p>This Virtual Machine (VM), called VirtualAGC-VM64, is intended to
      provide an easy and portable way to work with the materials from
      the Virtual AGC Project, and to update it, without the
      inconvenience of having to deal with complex installation
      instructions or the quirks of the various computer platforms
      (Windows, Mac OS, Linux, <i>et al.</i>, in multiple
      operating-system versions) that Virtual AGC targets.&nbsp; I won't
      describe the Virtual AGC Project in any detail here, since if you
      don't have a pretty good idea already what it is, then you can be
      assured that you don't need this VM at all and can stop reading
      right here.&nbsp; It suffices to say that the project provides
      information and software related to the flight computers used in
      the Gemini, Apollo, and Space Shuttle spacecraft and launch
      vehicles.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The VM itself is running <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://lubuntu.me/">a light-weight version of the 64-bit
        Ubuntu Linux operating system that's known as Lubuntu</a>.&nbsp;
      The VM can be run on any computer for which there's a version of <a
        moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://virtualbox.org">the
        VirtualBox virtualization environment</a>, or some common
      alternatives to it, but you likely know that already since you're
      viewing this message.<br>

    <h1><a name="JoystickSetup"></a>Setup of VirtualBox<br>
    </h1>
    <p>I doubt if most people using modern computers will need any setup
      to use the Virtual AGC VM, beyond whatever you've already done to
      be reading this pleasant little note.&nbsp; However, there are
      some optional things you might want to do.&nbsp; If so, shut down
      the VM, if it's running, and look at VirtualBox's settings for the
      VirtualAGC-VM64 VM:<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>As delivered, the VM is set up to use 4 CPU cores.&nbsp; This
        can be changed in the VirtualBox Settings/System/Processor
        window.&nbsp; I have run it with 1 CPU core without any apparent
        difficulty.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Also as delivered, the VM is set to use 4GB of memory.&nbsp;
        This can be changed in the VirtualBox
        Settings/System/Motherboard window.&nbsp; I have run it with 1GB
        without any apparent problem.</li>
      <li>If you want to use a USB joystick to simulate the Apollo LM
        Attitude Controller Assembly (ACA, also referred to as the
        rotational hand controller, or RHC), attach it to your computer
        and look at the VirtualBox Settings/USB window.&nbsp; Use the
        hot-buttons there to add a new "USB Device Filter", choosing
        your joystick from the list you're presented with.&nbsp; (You
        may see that the filter for "Logitech Extreme 3D Pro[3500]" is
        present.&nbsp; That's my own joystick.&nbsp; If by unlikely
        chance you're using that exact same model, then you may not have
        to configure anything!)&nbsp; Note that while the VM is running,
        it will take control of any of the devices listed in "USB Device
        Filters" away from your host computer, and only return control
        after shutting down the VM.<br>
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h1><a name="WhatsNot"></a>What's Not In this Virtual Machine?</h1>
    <p>The original documentation for Gemini, Apollo, and the Space
      Shuttle is not directly provided within the VM due to size
      constraints.&nbsp; (I assume you wouldn't want to deal with
      multi-terabyte downloads.)&nbsp; Refer instead to Virtual AGC's
      online <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/links2.html">Apollo &amp;
        Gemini document library</a> or the <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://www.ibiblio.org/apollo/links-shuttle.html">Space
        Shuttle document library</a>.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Flight software for Gemini is not provided, because no surviving
      copy has ever been discovered.&nbsp; Some short programs created
      for us by a couple of the original Gemini software developers are
      present.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Flight software for the Apollo Launch Vehicle Digital Computer
      (LVDC) and the Space Shuttle General Purpose Computers (GPC) are
      not publicly provided due to <i>presumed</i> "export"
      restrictions under the International Trade in Arms Regulations
      (ITAR).&nbsp; It is hoped that at some point we can acquire either
      export licenses or else a ruling that no export licenses are
      needed, at which point the flight software will be included.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Virtual AGC related software created by developers external to
      the Virtual AGC Project that's specific to the Windows or Mac OS
      platforms is not provided since it cannot be run on a Linux
      platform.<br>
    </p>
    <blockquote><font size="-1"><b>Aside:</b>&nbsp; It is possible to
        run <i>some</i> Windows software on Linux, via an emulation
        system called WINE (for the canard "WINE Is <i>Not</i> an
        Emulator").&nbsp; However, I'm not aware that any of the
        software mentioned in the paragraph above falls into that
        category.&nbsp; There is an article in the Orbiter Wiki (see the
        next section) that explains how to run an out-of-date version of
        Orbiter on Linux using WINE, so perhaps some day Orbiter w/NASSP
        will be included here.&nbsp; However, that day is not today.</font><br>

    <h1><a name="Lubuntu"></a>Working With Lubuntu</h1>
    <p>You're unlikely to be familiar with Lubuntu, but be confident
      that unfamiliarity won't matter very much to you.&nbsp; Since this
      VM is not intended to be a full-fledged system for you to do your
      daily work or obtain your non-AGC-related entertainment, it
      doesn't have much software installed on it that isn't directly
      relevant to the Virtual AGC Project.&nbsp; But it doesn't need
      much, and hopefully this short section will familiarize you almost
      everything you do need to know.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>As delivered, the desktop is configured so that a <i>single
          click</i> on any file opens it, similar to a web browser. If
        you prefer <i>double clicking</i>, as is the default for most
        operating systems, you can easily configure it. Open the
        file-system navigator by clicking on the <img
          moz-do-not-send="true" src="system-file-manager.svg" alt=""
          height="24"> icon on the toolbar at the bottom of the desktop.
        Use Edit/Preferences on the navigator's menu, and uncheck the
        box labeled "Open files with single click".</li>
      <li>Lubuntu's main menu is opened by using the icon that looks
        like&nbsp;<img moz-do-not-send="true"
          src="Lubuntu_logo_only.svg" alt="" height="24"> in the
        lower-left corner of the screen.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Web browser: Firefox is found on the Lubuntu main menu under
        the heading "Internet".</li>
      <li>Text editor: Several are installed (FeatherPad, Vim), on the
        Lubuntu main menu under the heading "Accessories", or obtained
        by right-clicking on a text file.&nbsp; I would recommend
        FeatherPad for ease of use, but some people may prefer Vim its
        more-advanced capabilities.</li>
      <li>Screenshots: I'd recommend using the VirtualBox View menu to
        make screenshots, rather than using Lubuntu's facilities or the
        facilities of the host computer.</li>
      <li>Recordings: The VirtualBox View menu has a Recording option
        you can use, and it is functional, but it's tricky and I
        wouldn't recommend it if you already have decent
        screen-recording software on the host computer.<br>
      </li>
      <li>System snapshots: If you have configured the VM how you like
        it and are considering doing anything which might adversely
        affect it (such as performing a Lubuntu update), you might want
        to make a snapshot of your current VM configuration before doing
        so. I would recommend using VirtualBox's snapshotting capability
        rather than attempting to install or use any native Lubuntu
        backup facilities for that purpose.</li>
