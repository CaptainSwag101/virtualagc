    <h1>What's this Virtual Machine?</h1>
    <p>This Virtual Machine (VM), called VirtualAGC-VM64, is intended to
      provide an easy and portable way to work with the materials from
      the Virtual AGC Project, and to update it, without the
      inconvenience of having to deal with the quirks of the various
      computer platforms (Windows, Mac OS, Linux, <i>et al.</i>, in
      multiple operating-system versions).&nbsp; I won't describe the
      Virtual AGC Project here, since if you don't have a pretty good
      idea already what it is, then you can be assured that you don't
      need this VM at all and can stop reading right here.<br>
    </p>
    <p>The VM itself is running <a moz-do-not-send="true"
        href="https://lubuntu.me/">a light-weight version of the 64-bit
        Ubuntu Linux operating system that's known as Lubuntu</a>.&nbsp;
      The VM can be run on any computer for which there's a version of <a
        moz-do-not-send="true" href="https://virtualbox.org">the
        VirtualBox virtualization environment</a>, but you likely know
      that already since you're viewing this message.<br>
    </p>
    <h1>Virtual AGC Facilities Available on the VM</h1>
    <p>By default, there are just seven icons on the VM's desktop (aside
      from the Info icon, <img moz-do-not-send="true"
        src="Icon-round-Question_mark.svg.png" alt=""
        height="24">, that you used to open this explanation you're
      reading right now):<br>
    </p>
    <p><img moz-do-not-send="true"
        src="ApolloPatch2-transparent.png"
        alt="" height="24"> opens the VirtualAGC GUI application.&nbsp;
      That application is a portal that allows you to run an AGC/AGS
      simulation in a multitude of configurations, using any available
      version of the original AGC or AGS software, or to view any of
      that original software.<br>
    </p>
    <p><img moz-do-not-send="true" src="Firefox_logo.svg" alt=""
        height="24"> takes you to the Virtual AGC Project's main
      website.<br>
    </p>
    <p><img moz-do-not-send="true" src="github.com.png" alt=""
        height="24"> takes you to the Virtual AGC Project's software
      repository at GitHub.<br>
    </p>
    <p><img moz-do-not-send="true" src="update.png" alt="" height="24">
      updates the Virtual AGC software in this VM by downloading all of
      the latest source code from the GitHub repository, and rebuilding
      it.<br>
    </p>
    <p><img moz-do-not-send="true" src="codeblocks.png" alt=""
        height="24"> lets you perform visual debugging on AGC
      software.&nbsp; It is actually a folder, and in that folder there
      are debugging projects for a variety (albeit a small minority) of
      the available AGC software versions.&nbsp; Among those included
      are the Apollo 11 Command Module software (Comanche 055) and Lunar
      Module software (Luminary 099).<br>
    </p>
    <p><img moz-do-not-send="true" src="archive.org.png" alt=""
        height="24"> takes you the Virtual AGC Project section of The
      Internet Archive, which contains the highest-available resolution
      scans of documents which may be available only at lower
      resolutions or lossier compression elsewhere, such as at the
      document library on our main website.<br>
    </p>
    <p><img moz-do-not-send="true" src="LM.png" alt="" height="24">
      takes you to the website of the NASSP (i.e., Apollo) add-on for
      the Orbiter spaceflight simulator, into which Virtual AGC is
      integrated. Unfortunately, in <i>this</i> VM you cannot actually
      fly simulated Apollo missions using the Orbiter/NASSP. That's
      because Orbiter is compatible with Microsoft Windows only, and
      cannot be run on a Linux system. Nor can I freely provide a
      Windows-based VM on which to run Orbiter, because unlike Linux,
      Microsoft Windows cannot legally be freely distributed.</p>
    <h1>Working with Lubuntu</h1>
    <p>You're unlikely to be familiar with Lubuntu, but be confident
      that unfamiliarity won't matter very much to you.&nbsp; Since this
      VM is not intended to be a full-fledged system for you to do your
      daily work or have your entertainment, it doesn't have much
      software installed on it that isn't directly relevant to the
      Virtual AGC Project.&nbsp; But it doesn't need much, and hopefully
      this short section will familiarize you almost everything you do
      need to know.<br>
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>As delivered, the desktop is configured so that a <i>single
          click</i> on any file opens it, similar to a web browser. If
        you prefer <i>double clicking</i>, as is the default for most
        operating systems, you can easily configure it. Open the
        file-system navigator by clicking on the <img
          moz-do-not-send="true" src="system-file-manager.svg" alt=""
          height="24"> icon on the toolbar at the bottom of the desktop.
        Use Edit/Preferences on the navigator's menu, and uncheck the
        box labeled "Open files with single click".</li>
      <li>Lubuntu's main menu is opened by using the icon that looks
        like&nbsp;<img moz-do-not-send="true"
          src="Lubuntu_logo_only.svg" alt="" height="24"> in the
        lower-left corner of the screen.<br>
      </li>
      <li>Command-line window: There are several different command-line
        terminals you can use (QTerminal, UXterm, Xterm).&nbsp; They are
        all found on the Lubuntu main menu under the heading "System
        Tools".&nbsp; I would recommend using QTerminal.</li>
      <li>Web browser: Firefox is found on the main menu under the
        heading "Internet".</li>
      <li>Text editor: Several are installed (FeatherPad, Vim), on the
        Lubuntu main menu under the heading "Accessories", or obtained
        by right-clicking on a text file.&nbsp; I would recommend
        FeatherPad for ease of use, but some people may prefer Vim its
        more-advanced capabilities.</li>
      <li>Lubuntu updater: To update Lubuntu itself, you can use the
        Lubuntu Update under the "Preferences" heading of the Lubuntu
        main menu. However, any updates to the C/C++ compilers, to
        wxWidgets, or to any other package required by Virtual AGC's
        build system could have the unintended consequence of future
        failures when trying to update Virtual AGC. Therefore, it is
        better not to update Lubuntu until/unless you see a notification
        on the Virtual AGC website that it's desirable to do so.</li>
      <li>Screenshots and recordings: I'd recommend using the VirtualBox
        View menu to do that rather than using Lubuntu's facilities,
        which may not have been installed.</li>
      <li>System snapshots: If you have configured the VM how you like
        it and are considering doing anything which might adversely
        affect it (such as performing a Lubuntu update), you might want
        to make a snapshot of your current VM configuration before doing
        so. I would recommend using VirtualBox's snapshotting capability
        than attempting to install or use any native Lubuntu facilities
        for that purpose.</li>
    </ul>
