/*
 * This is a C-language patch for CALL INLINEs #76-77 in PREPLITE.xpl, as
 * used by XCOM-I in building PASS1 of HAL/S-FC.
 *
 * See the comments in patch57.c and patch59.c.  I'm not sure what these
 * inlines do, but I don't provide anything to deal with them in the Python
 * port of PASS1, and it didn't seem to hurt anything.
