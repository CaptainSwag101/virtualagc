/*
 * This is a C-language patch for CALL INLINE #24 in HALINCL/VMEM3.xpl, as
 * used by XCOM-I in building PASS1 of HAL/S-FC.
 *
 * I'm not sure of the purpose of this INLINE -- it's used by INLINEs #19-23 --
 * but it's actually unreachable, so this patch is empty.  I include it merely
 * to document the fact that the INLINE needs no further action for correct
 * operation.
